# Restaurant review app - stage 1

### Description

This is a project made for Udacity's front end nanodegree.

### Installation

Please clone or download this repository to your hard drive.

### How to run (as per Udacity's instructions for this project)

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

### Goals for this project

1. Make the design usable and responsive on all screen sizes

2. Improve the app accessibility

3. Build a service worker that allows offline content to be displayed.
